# Changes made, features added and bugs fixed
In general the development follows the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) scheme. As the simulation is parameterized by the project file, the structure and meaning of this file represents the API of the simulation engine. Evaluating compatibility then follows required changes in the project file. This is complicated by the implementation of the individual energy system components, which happens within the framework but is also reasonably independent of the simulation model. A change in the implementation may have big effects on simulation results without requiring any change in the project file. It is up to the developers to find a workable middle ground.

## Versions
Starting with v1.0.0 breaking changes in the project file concerning component models or individual simulation parameters and settings constitute a cause to bump the minor number of the version. The major number is reserved for breaking changes in the overall structure of the project file. New features may increase the minor number if they constitute sufficient new work. It should be considered that users wish to stick to a specific minor number until they find the time to update their inputs. A migration feature might be considered in the feature, but is not implemented as of v1.0.0. Thus fixes should preferably bump the patch number only and care should be taken when updating the minor number.

### Version 1.0.1
* Update README with instructions making note of the --threads=auto argument of Julia
* Fix a bug where the energy and temperature flow dynamic output channels of Bus would not show up in certain cases
  * This happened for input-output combinations that are forbidden by the default case in the project config, but enabled by a control module for specific conditions, which were not taken into account when setting the output channels

### Version 1.0.0
Listed in the following are changes since the last beta-release v0.15.1. A full list of all features of ReSiE as of v1.0.0 can be found in the documentation.

#### Package renaming
* The julia package has been renamed to ResieQuasi. This name was chosen to avoid naming conflicts with existing packages in the General registry. The preferred name and spelling is ReSiE, as part of the QuaSi project. You can find an explanation of these two names in the online documentation.
  * If the package name is used extensively in code, a handy trick is to use `import ResieQuasi as Resie`

#### Grid connections
* The two component models `GridInput` and `GridOutput` have been renamed to `GridSupply` and `GridSink`. These names were chosen to be in line with the names of other supply/sink components and because "input" and "output" where deemed confusing as they relate to the whole energy system, not the invidiual component. The models work exactly the same as before, only the name has changed.

#### Minor changes
* Updates to the scenario reference files
* Set compat entries in file `Project.toml`. This is mostly a requirement for the General registry, but also helps to specificy a known working set of dependencies, which should reduce a source of errors caused by new versions of dependencies.

## Pre-1.0-releases
As per the definition of semantic versioning and the reality of early development, in versions prior to 1.0.0 any release might break compatibility. To alleviate this somewhat, the meaning of major-minor-patch is "downshifted" to zero-major-minor. However some breaking changes may slip beneath notice.

### Version 0.15.1
* Update detailed battery model with various fixes and improvements identified during validation studies
  * This includes a new output for the current of the battery
  * Scenarios have been updated to reflect these changes
* Fix an issue with parameter validation for required parameters that have been "toggled off" due to conditionals on other parameters

### Version 0.15.0

#### Major feature: Parameter studies, optimisation and sensitivity analysis

* Add a `parameter_study` section for repeatedly simulating an energy system with different input parameters
  * Define variable parameters using optimisation bounds, starting values, explicit variation values or generated ranges
  * Use sums or means of simulation outputs as objectives, as well as results from the economic and emissions calculations
  * Combine objectives using `sum` or a weighted `linear` function, or retain them as separate objectives for multi-objective optimisation
* Add systematic parameter variation
  * Evaluate the Cartesian product of parameter values, zip corresponding values or generate a configured number of random samples
* Add single- and multi-objective optimisation
  * Add support for algorithms from `Optim`, `BlackBoxOptim`, `Metaheuristics`, `NLopt` and `NOMAD`

  * Add `objective_senses` for minimising or maximising individual objectives in multi-objective optimisation
  * Add an optional refinement stage for continuing a single-objective optimisation from its best result
* Add global and local sensitivity analyses
  * Global sensitivity fits a polynomial chaos expansion surrogate and calculates first- and total-order Sobol indices over the configured parameter bounds
  * Local sensitivity changes one parameter at a time around configured starting values or the best available result, using either explicit evaluation values or a relative variation
  * Reuse matching results from parameter variation, optimisation and preceding sensitivity calculations before performing additional simulations
  * Sensitivity analysis currently supports single-objective studies only
* Use Julia threads for parameter variation, sensitivity calculations and optimisation algorithms that support parallel evaluation
* Add CSV and interactive HTML outputs for parameter-study results
  * Add an all-results CSV and separate global- and local-sensitivity CSV outputs
  * Add optional continuous CSV writing so partial results remain available during long or interrupted studies
  * Add convergence, matrix, objective-parameter, parallel-coordinate and interactive 3D plots
  * Add global- and local-sensitivity plots
  * Add an option to include or exclude local-sensitivity simulations from the general parameter-study plots
* Add `disable_all_simulation_outputs`, enabled by default, to suppress the regular output files of individual simulations during a parameter study
  * If individual simulation outputs are enabled, their file names include the varied parameter values to avoid overwriting results from other runs
* Add parameter-study status messages, result summaries and output paths to the new general log
* Improve interruption handling so that `Ctrl+C` stops running and pending simulations and preserves the available parameter-study results for configured outputs
* Add the example `multi_family_house_optim.json` demonstrating component-size optimisation and global and local sensitivity analyses
* Add two scenarios `multi_family_house_optim` and `multi_family_house_param_variation` including adaption of the scenario CLI to support parameter study runs

#### Breaking changes

* Rename general output-path parameters for consistency:
  * `csv_output_file` → `csv_output_file_path`
  * `output_plot_file` → `output_plot_file_path`
  * `sankey_plot_file` → `sankey_plot_file_path`
* Rename CSV-related parameters to use lowercase `csv` consistently:
  * `write_summary_CSV` → `write_summary_csv`
  * `output_economic_CSV` → `output_economic_csv`
  * `economic_CSV_file_path` → `economic_csv_file_path`
  * `output_emissions_CSV` → `output_emissions_csv`
  * `emissions_CSV_file_path` → `emissions_csv_file_path`

#### Minor changes / fixes

* Add `annuity_opex_including_energies` to the available economic results
* Prevent file-only plots from opening graphical windows randomly during CLI execution
* Fix optional geothermal collector and probe figures so the intended plot object is not disturbing other plots
* Fix logger shutdown so final log messages are written before the log files are closed

#### Internal changes

* Add the new optimisation and sensitivity package dependencies `BlackBoxOptim`, `Metaheuristics`, `NLopt`, `NOMAD` and `PolyChaos`
* Separate parameter-study execution and output generation into `parameter_study.jl` and `parameter_study_output.jl`
* Rename `file_output.jl` to `simulation_output.jl` and generalise simulation-result extraction for parameter-study objectives
* Add a `GlobalInfo` log level for messages that apply to an entire parameter study rather than an individual simulation. For parameter studies, the min_log_level is set to GlobalInfo
* Cache reusable profiles and the order of operations for repeated simulation runs
* Update examples and scenario inputs to use the renamed IO settings
  
### Version 0.14.5
* add check&error for profiles values being Inf or NaN
* add possibility to apply storage_driven control module to storages used as source by adding the parameter "control_mode"
* fix calculation of averaged input/output temperature in heat pump failing in certain cases and update reference output plot of scenario secondary_interface due to now fixed output temperature of heat pump
* fix bug in set_storage_transfer!() for secondary interfaces of heat pumps 
* clarify warn message in heat pump if COP falls below 1.0 if a plf_function is applied. This is still misleading as this warn message appear for single slices before a check is performed if min_usage_fraction is valid.

### Version 0.14.4
* Improve error handling during project loading and component operation
  * Add clearer error messages for unknown component types
  * Add clearer error messages for invalid calls to `set_storage_transfer!()`due to empty interfaces
* Add missing CSV reference output for scenario `chpp_two_hyst`

### Version 0.14.3
* Change fixed output precision to use significant digits for rounding instead of decimal digits
* Update all scenario outputs due to to changes in the fixed output precision
* Add check and error message to scenario CLI if the given scenario does not exist
* Fix wrong conditional in GeothermalHeatCollector

### Version 0.14.2
* Fix order of operations for transformers with active part load connected to middle busses with both input and output branch: additional potential steps are now added where required
* Fix heat pump behaviour with secondary output interfaces in cases with zero energy demand on the interface with the higher bus priority
* Fix error message in heat pump slice splitting for primary and secondary output interfaces
* Update scenario `secondary_interfaces` to reflect corrected heat pump output temperatures in secondary interfaces

### Version 0.14.1
* add two new examples and scenarios for a multi-family house and a district, both with economic evaluation and GHG emissions
* add the generation of a summary CSV (`write_summary_CSV`) that calculates means, sums, minimums, and maximums of all outputs with auto-detection of the parameter type
* add emissions and economic outputs and summary CSV outputs to the scenario comparison and reference results, as well as several missing CSV outputs
* add the parameter `capex_specific_scale` for convenient scaling of investment cost functions
* clarify the installation instructions for ReSiE in the README
* align the formatting of file paths in log output

### Version 0.14.0

#### Major feature: Costs and emissions
* Add optional economic and GHG emissions calculations
  * Includes component-specific investment costs, operating costs, energy prices, subsidies, embodied emissions, emission factors, emissions credits and unmet-energy costs
  * Add CSV and plot outputs for economic and GHG emissions results
  * Add different repetition methods of price and emission profiles using the parameter `repeat_method` 

#### Breaking changes
* Rework IO settings for CSV output, output plots and Sankey plots by splitting output mode and custom output specification
  * This changes the project file syntax for custom output definitions. Please check the documentation for how the new format works.
  * Update default Sankey colours and improve handling of incomplete custom colour specifications. Unknown media are now assigned random colours, but these colours are consistent between runs.
* Change handling of unmet demands and surplus supplies so they are assigned to sinks and sources and no longer to busses
  * Improve handling of unmet energies in single and connected busses
  * Change output of balance warnings to a new format: Balance warnings are now separated into interface balance warnings and component balance errors; proxy busses no longer create duplicate balance warnings
  * Update Sankey plotting to display unmet energies more reliably and consistently
* Remove legacy component type GridConnection
  * Please use GridInput and GridOutput instead, which function the same, except they do not require setting the parameter `is_source`.

#### Minor changes / fixes
* Fix multiple issues in profile repetition, profile trimming, output paths, line plot ordering, optional parameter validation and unit descriptions
* Add IO setting `fixed_output_precision` to make CSV, plot, Sankey, economic and emissions outputs perfectly reproducible. This is mostly used for testing.

#### Internal changes
* Refactor simulation parameters, IO settings, economic parameters, emissions parameters, control parameters and control modules to use SSOT parameter definitions
* Improve scenario tooling and update scenario reference files
  * The scenario command `compare_ooo` is replaced by `compare`, which compares all relevant output files. This includes automatically ignoring expected differences in execution time and timestamps.
  * The new compare tool can be used to quickly check all scenarios for any difference at all.

### Version 0.13.12
* Simplify internal use of COP functions with constant value
* Simplify internal loading of optional profiles and constant values for all components
* Fix some misconfigured test cases that may break in rare cases depending on undefined order of iteration
* Update parameter "probe_type" of GeothermalProbes to use string options instead of numbers
  * Previously it had options "1" and "2", now has options "single U-pipe" and "double U-pipe"
* Split GridConnection into two components GridInput and GridOutput
  * It is still possible to use GridConnection as type, but using GridInput and GridOutput is the new recommended use
  * GridInput and GridOutput do not require the parameter "is_source" as that is implicit in the type name
* Refactor all components to use a new mechanism of construction of instances during project loading
  * This new mechanism uses a single source of truth (SSOT) concept to define all metadata about parameters in a single location in the code, such that changes only have to be done at one point instead of multiple
  * The metadata captures the previously implemented logic of parameters concerning valid values, defaults and inter-dependencies between parameters, as well as some new logic. This also includes metadata that ReSiE does not utilise directly, but connecting systems, in particular user interfaces, might require or find useful.
* Add a function that systems programmatically interfacing with ReSiE via a shared Julia environment can access to get a complete definition of all parameters of all component types
* Add IO setting "show_detailed_errors" which, when enabled, shows more detailed error messages during component construction
* Ensure that most transformer and storage component can accept zero power / capacity
  * This is prepatory work for optimisation and parameter studies, where a component might be reduced to zero sizing while still maintaining its place in the energy system (whereas completely removing the component is much more complicated)
* Fix rare race condition with multithreading when module-global variable EnergySystems.medium_categories is checked during output generation.

### Version 0.13.11
* Changed transformer potential handling so `MaxEnergy` is no longer updated in interfaces toward (proxy) buses and is instead written only to the bus balance table, allowing `balance_on()` of the bus to correctly handle multiple transformers with multiple potential steps; linked interfaces remain an exception and still require to update `MaxEnergy` in the interfaces during potential step for correct communication.
* Fixed `inner_distribute` in buses to avoid `Inf - Inf`, which previously produced `NaN` values in the bus balance table in some rare cases

### Version 0.13.10
* Fix function reorder_src_snk_connected_to-transformer not working after merges of new battery model

### Version 0.13.9
* Add new transformer component ThermalBooster that uses low temperature heat to preheat a thermal demand and a second energy source to reach the desired output temperature
* Add new scenario low_ex_district_heating to show the use of a ThermalBooster
* Ensure correct handling of add!() or sub!() of a value of zero for direct connections between transformers and other components that have some interfaces set to an energy > 0 and one interface to an energy of 0 in their process step
* Improve handling of 1-to-1 interfaces between transformers and other components (except buses and transformers) in set_max_energy() to allow transformers to increase the demanded or delivered energy in process compared to the potential step; therefore the max energy is no longer written into the interface of the direct 1-to-1 connections during the potential step of transformers
* Fix ooo to always place the process/load step of flexible sources, flexible sinks and storages that are connected to a transformer directly or via busses always behind the process of this transformer in the order of operations
* Add possibility to calculate the ooo for energy systems with multiple transformers that are all connected in their input and output to the same (proxy) bus without a warning saying that contradictions were found or other ooo warnings
* Add general_log as reference in all scenarios
* Update scenarios interconnected_STES and p2h_stes_stc due to changed ooo (results have not changed)

### Version 0.13.8
* Implement complex model for battery simulation
  * A simple model remains with adjusted parameters. This model includes constant efficiency of dis-/charging, dis-/charging rate limitations and self-discharge as well as simple load/capacity tracking
  * The complex model is designed around calculating the state of the battery with a detailed electrical model. The capacity, current load and dis-/charging power is calculated dynamically and includes effect such as aging (through cycling and chemical deterioration), heat build-up and varying efficiency of dis-/charging depending on power and cell temperature.
  * The complex model works for different battery chemistries if manufacturer data is available. Redox-flow batteries are not included in the model.
* Rename parameter `load` of generic model `Storage` to `initial_load` and change meaning to a percentage of capacity as initial charge
* Fix typo in default parameters of control module `storage_driven`
* Fix problem with loading profiles for model `GenericHeatSource`
* Fix wrong check for control module functionality in callback `reorder_operations`
* Fix that the exact value of the upper limit of `field` COP-functions was not included in the interpolation, leading to errors even though the value was within the field definition
* Fix an issue with auxiliary output plots formats

### Version 0.13.7
* Fix reading of global weather file not working correctly in some cases
* Add option to write CSV output continuously, meaning in every timestep
  * The old behaviour was to always do it this way. The new behaviour changes the default to writing the output after the simulation loop and adds a IO setting to enable continuous output if desired.

### Version 0.13.6
* fix bug of missing process step in OOO of transformers connected to grids in middle-bus-branches

### Version 0.13.5
* Add new FVM-based ground-model for STES to better represent losses into the ground. The model is validated against all relevant IEA ES Task 39 testcases.
* Update unit for cp from [kJ/kgK] to [J/kgK] for all components for consistency. This is especially relevant for the buffer tank!
* Add the possibility to treat profiles as volume flow for FixedSink and FixedSource in combination with STES
* Add new FVM ground model of STES to scenario "interconnected_STES"
* Update scenario "multisector_district" due to former changes in v0.12.5 and change color of Sankey to be aligned with DrawIO sketch
* Fix bug in bus to handle energy_flows between -epsilon and zero
* Fix calling InputError with empty constructor not working correctly

### Version 0.13.4
* Fix HeatPump producing negative energies in rare cases
* Fix an erroneous error message in Bus to cause the entire energy system being printed on console
* Fix BufferTank updating supply temperature between slices
  * While the previous implementation is a more realistic option for mixed or balanced models below the switch point, it causes problems because the component then writes a higher max energy in its control step than it can actually supply in process. This fix solves that problem but introduces an inaccuracy as the entire energy supplied in a timestep is at the temperature before discharging.
* Fix internal issue with how some error messages are handled
* Fix small syntax/logic error in calculation order of operations
  * It is not clear if this error has ever occured

### Version 0.13.3
* hotfix for infinite loop in heat pump with COP=1.0

### Version 0.13.2
* Add secondary interfaces for the heat pump: 
  * The heat pump thermal output can now provide a secondary interface (`m_heat_out_secondary`) to the same heat bus as the primary output interface (`m_heat_out`).
  * Both outputs appear as separate bus inputs (e.g. `HP_01` and `HP_01#secondary`) at the bus and can be ordered in `input_order` to realise strategies like: “PV-driven heat first, other bus inputs next, grid-driven heat last”. This also works dynamically and for proxy busses.
  * If a component has a secondary interface, a potential step is always added ahead of its produce to ensure correct calculation.
  * **Beta:** only supported for the heat pump’s thermal output and may not work for all control-module / system combinations.
* Bugfix in heat pump: can now operate with COP = 1.0 
* Add new scenario `secondary_interfaces` to illustrate the functionality

### Version 0.13.1
* Change use of paths to be relative to a configurable base path instead of relying on paths relative to the CWD
* Fix run registry accumulating simulation runs and the CLI not removing runs after finishing them
* Move setting the global logger out of Resie_Logger into the code calling the logger
  * This is required because some use of ReSiE does not want to use a global logger

### Version 0.13.0
* Rename BoundedSupply to FlexibleSupply and BoundedSink to FlexibleSink as well as renaming the system functions bounded_source and bounded_sink to flexible_source and flexible_sink
* Clarify some terms in the code, doc blocks and comments in regard to the use of "order of operations" and "step"
* Implement control callbacks that can modifiy the order of operations for a timestep as well as reordering the priorities and energy flow matrix on busses (as both are necessary to ensure correct calculation)
* Add control module economic_control making use of the new callbacks to implement an operational strategy assigning different priorities and allowed flows depending on a given price profile and a threshold value
* Add scenario reorder_operations showcasing how control module economic_control can be used
* Remove control module economical_discharge as it was only used for examplatory purposes and is no longer required
* Add additional auxiliary output on the modified order of operations if corresponding control modules are active

### Version 0.12.6
* model improvements for geothermal collector: change explicit Euler formulation to implicit Euler for the calculation of heat transfer in the soil around the geothermal collector due to massive computational speed improvements. The results are very close to the former implementation.
* update scenario "simple_geothermal_collector" accordingly
* add two new julia packages: LinearAlgebra and SparseArrays
* improve warn message for profiles with a forgotten TimeZone

### Version 0.12.5
* The energy flow matrix of a bus can now be used to specify a custom order of each input-output connection using consecutive numbers starting from `1` in the energy flow matrix (or `0` for denied connections). This only works for single busses that are not interconnected to other busses.
* Now, transformers can increase the energy for inputs/outputs in their process step compared to the MaxEnergies calculated in their potential step (also in a second potential step).  For all other components, however,  the MaxEnergy set during control can never be exceeded. 
* To input a custom `order_of_operation`, the UAC is now separated from the step by a `:` instead of an empty space to allow UACs to contain empty spaces

### Version 0.12.4
* Changed default value of parameter wind_speed_reduction of component SolarthermalCollector from 0.5 to 1.0

### Version 0.12.3
* Add component `UTIR` as a unified implementation of electric transformers, inverters and rectifiers (UTIR).
* Add scenario `electric_transformer` to showcase the new component

### Version 0.12.2
* add optional possibility to start the output of simulation results later using the simulation parameter `start_output` set to a DateTime after `start`
* add optional parameter `force_profiles_to_repeat` in simulation parameter to force profiles to repeat, even if `repeat_profile` is not set in the profile header

### Version 0.12.1
* add the possibility to repeat profiles using the parameter "repeat_profile" in the profile header

### Version 0.12.0
* Add possibility to output energy and temperature flows between components that are connected via busses in plot and CSV output. Now the following inputs are available for `csv_output_keys` and `output_plot`
  * `nothing`: no information will be plotted or written to CSV file
  * `all_excl_flows`: outputs all available information without energy and temperature flows. Note that they are now sorted alphabetically!
  *  `all_incl_flows`: outputs all available information including energy and temperature flows, as long as the connection via the energy matrix of the bus is allowed. Temperature is only output if energy is flowing. If no temperature is set for the flow, no output will be created. Note that the outputs are now sorted alphabetically, starting with the regular output followed by the flows.
  *  custom output: see documentation for syntax. Note that now the order of the input represents the order of the output in plot and CSV.
* Change the definition of `output_refs` for components with multiple outputs to achieve uniqueness in connections independent of the order of the input. Now, the `output_refs` can be defined as dict, the old method of input a list of targets is still valid, but a warn message is thrown for components with more than one output interface (currently CHPP, ELY). For components with only one output, the simple list is fully sufficient.
* Change separator in input definition for specific IN or OUT output channels from " " to ":" to allow spaces in media names
* All tests and scenarios were adjusted to be conform with this new syntax.

### Version 0.11.4
* Add callback `check_src_to_snk` for controlling the flow of energy between a specific source and a specific sink on transformers that implement a layered approach to energy flow calculation, e.g. heat pumps
* Add control module `forbid_src_to_snk` to implement this callback by forbidding the energy flow between a defined source and sink
* Refactor control module loading such that it is no longer necessary to hardcode the files and classes, which eases development of new control modules

### Version 0.11.3
* Add solar thermal collector model (STC)
* Add detailed seasonal thermal storage model (STES)
* Add solar radiation model for sun position and beam and diffuse irradiance in a plane. Also improves the interpolation method to better represent the needs of irradiation (energy conservation in every hour and consideration of sunset and sunrise)
* Add new control module "negotiate_temperature" which defines temperature between two components with flexible temperatures. This also includes improvements in the control possibilities of the geothermal probe.
* Add new control module "limit_cooling_input_temperature" for electrolysers with STES
* Multiple bug fixes and improvements in the determination of the order of operation to cover more energy system configurations, especially circle-transformer (input and output to the same (Proxy)Bus) and busses with minimum part load ratio set; also differ between general bounded sources/sinks and grid input/output in the base order
* Complete rework of temperature communication between components. This includes:
  * Min and max temperatures are now part of the MaxEnergy struct (and no longer in the interfaces) and set during Control/Process and also using the add!() functions in Process. 
  * Rework of the bus distribute and balance_on to better consider temperatures. Also update all functions dealing with MaxEnergy structs within the bus to consider these temperatures.
  * Adaptation of the bypass of the heat pump which now limits the temperature during bypass to the actual demanded temperature
  * Add another method to recalculate energies triggered by the bus ("recalculate_max_energy" in MaxEnergy) as second method in addition to "has_calculated_all_maxima"
  * Adaptation of the order of Control-Steps in the OoO to allow STES and STC to gather information of temperatures during their control.
  * Adjust Electrolyser to handle and communicate UACs of energies
* Changed definition of Losses and Gains: Losses are now negative in output, Gains are positive in output. Note that in the components themselves Losses are still handled as positive and Gains as negative values!
* Fix typos in multiple files
* Adapted scenarios according to the changes made and added two new scenarios: "stc_2_demands" and "p2h_stes_stc"
* Updated example multisector district to use new STES model
* Add "epsilon" to input simulation parameter
* Remove balance_on() functions of storages as they are now covered by the general implementation
* Fix URL to Julia installation page
*  Multiple bug fixes and improvements in Profiles and other parts of ReSiE
*  Improve robustness of storages against the order of process and load steps

### Version 0.11.2
* Improve error output for reading in profiles from files by including the line where the error occurred
* Adjust ReSiE CLI to handle Ctrl+c more gracefully
* Add tests for control module profile_limited, which previously had none
* Updates to heat pump:
  * Introduce parameter model_type with three options:
    * simplified: A model that assumes a constant part load factor (PLF) function, meaning that efficiency does not depend on the part load ratio (PLR)
    * inverter: This replaces the previous optimisation model, which tries to adjust the PLRs for each slice such that less electricity is consumed (as inverter-driven heat pumps are more efficient with a PLR less than 1.0)
    * on-off: This now also makes use of optimisation to adjust the PLRs of each slice, however in this case to "fill out" the timestep completely, such that the active time becomes 1.0. This is intended as the PLF function of on-off heat pumps are supposed to capture cycling losses when the heat pump repeatedly turns on and off to meet a demand less than its full power.
  * Add option to model a constant electricity loss even when the heat pump is not running
  * Add minimum usage fraction (not to be confused with minimum power) as parameter, causing the heat pump to not run when the calculated usage is below this threshold

### Version 0.11.1
* Fix profiles (type "datestamp") to correctly handle data with and without DST

### Version 0.11.0
* Restructure the CLI and how simulations are performed with it.
  * Instead of a single call to the CLI script, that runs the simulation and then returns to the shell, it now puts the user into an interactive CLI that keeps prompting for commands until exited. This has the advantage that performing multiple runs without changing the code results in a significant performance boost for runs after the first one, as the code does not have be compiled again and is reused.
  * The interactive part can be circumvented by adding the command and associated arguments to the call starting the CLI. An optional argument `--exit-after-run` will exit the CLI after the simulation is done.
  * **Note:** **This is a breaking change**, as the previous command to run a simulation, e.g. `julia --project=. src/resie-cli.jl examples/simple_heat_pump.json`, no longer works. With the new CLI a single simulation run with no interactive part now looks like this: `julia --project=. src/resie-cli.jl run --exit-after-run examples/simple_heat_pump.json`. Please update any scripts or automated processes to reflect these changes.
* Add additional output of simulation progress/status
* Minor fixes:
  * Remove spurious warning during precompilation due to overly general import
  * Fix hardcoded path of output files in info log message

### Version 0.10.7
* Update HeatPump to implement the detailed model as described in the documentation. This includes:
  * Calculation of the COP as a customisable function of the source and sink temperatures
  * Customisable temperature-dependent minimum/maximum power functions
  * Part load ratio (PLR) dependent efficiency as customisable function modifying the COP depending on the PLR
  * Optimisation of the PLR if the heat pump is not working under full load. This is a useful feature for inverter heat pumps, that typically work most efficiently at a PLR of less than 100%. **Note:** this optimisation could be improved and does not always calculate the true optimum. There also known problems where activating this feature will lead to energy balances not quite working out. Hopefully this will be fixed in future updates.
  * Handling multiple combinations of input and output (so-called "slices") in each timestep. For example a heat pump can supply both room heating and domestic hot water (DHW) demands at the same time, calculating each with a different COP and power
  * Losses of power and heat input that are not included in the heat output as these represent true losses to the environment, as compared to losses of efficiency, which are included in the COP function.
  * More output channels to make it easier to understand how the heat pump works
* New control module "temperature_sorting", which enables sorting the inputs or outputs of a heat pump by temperature. This can be used to override a static order, derived from priorities on a bus, with an order that chooses the highest or lowest temperature first.

### Version 0.10.6
* add the possibility to output the weather data from EPW and dat-files to the lineplot and CSV output
* add two more interpolation methods for segmentation of data: "stepwise", "linear_classic", "linear_time_preserving", "linear_solar_radiation"
* the time zone can now be specified in the simulation_parameters to overwrite the time zone provided by the weather file
* change the internal handling of profile time step during segmentation and aggregation from seconds to milliseconds
* add tests for segmentation algorithms

### Version 0.10.5
* restructur import of profiles (constant value, custom profile, from weather file) to a generalised function
* correct input variable naming for ambient temperature in buffer tank and geothermal collector

### Version 0.10.4
* Update of buffer tank / STTES model. Now three different models are available, each with and without losses:
  * ideally stratified: Supplies energy consistently at "high_temperature". Losses reduce energy but do not affect temperature.
  * ideally mixed: Fully mixed model, with temperature output depending on the current load. Losses decrease both energy and temperature.
  * balanced: Combines both models. A full tank behaves as ideally stratified, transitioning to ideally mixed as the tank empties.
* Add workaround for storage_driven control module not recognizing a full storage if losses are activated. This can be done cleaner in the future.
* Scenario "chpp_two_hyst" now includes losses in buffer tank

### Version 0.10.3
* Add the possibility to create optional figures at the end of the simulation period
* Fix balance_on() of storages for direct connections
* Finalisation of the geothermal collector (successfully validated against TRNSYS and DELPHIN):
  * Revision of the entire model, including bug fixed and improvements
  * Add automatic generation of the numerical grid
  * Add time-shiftable plot of the temperature distribution (requires GLMakie package, activate with auxiliary_plots)
  * Add scenario using the geothermal collector
* Update installation instructions for ReSiE

### Version 0.10.2
* Internal changes concerning global state in the package scope:
  * Moving helper functions watt_to_wh and wh_to_watts into the simulation parameters
  * Providing access to the instances of a run via a package-global registry

### Version 0.10.1
* Bugfix for order of operation not determining middle busses with grids correctly
* Bugfix in grid (sink) setting wrong min/max temperature in control

### Version 0.10.0
* Change handling and definition of timesteps by introducing datetime indexes for profiles and for internal handling:
  * Profile values in ReSiE are now defined as the mean/sum of the timespan following the current timestep. This affects mainly the weather data from a global weather file. If this is not used, any definition can be used, the provided profiles just have to be consistent.
  * Simulation start and end time have to be given as datetime now.
  * Simulation time step can now be given in multiple time formats: seconds, minutes, hours
  * Profiles now have to be referenced in time and have to cover the simulation start and end time.
  * Major restructuring of profile definition: Can now be startdate & timestepsize, startdate & timestamp or a datestamp with custom format.
  * Add parameter "data_type" in profiles and explicitly setting it as "intensive" or "extensive" values. "is_power" is no longer used.
  * Add parameter "time_shift_seconds" in profiles to manually shift profile data by a given time span
  * Add parameter "use_linear_segmentation" if linear and not stepwise interpolation should be used for segmentation.
  * Fix import of weather data to meet new time definition in ReSiE, especially for intensive values of EPW which are defined as values at the time indicated.
  * Add multi-year usage of weather data files. Weatherdata from weather file can have any year.
  * Improve segmentation and aggregation algorithms. Segmentation can now be either linear or stepwise (default) interpolation, depending on user input.
  * Add handling of daylight savings: Internally, ReSiE uses now local standard time. Profiles with a datestamp including DST are converted to local standard time. Output is always local standard time without DST. DST in EWP-Header will not be considered.
  * Add handling of leap days: They are ignored in all input and output. See documentation for details.
  * Line plot x-axis is now configurable to show seconds, hours or a datetime index.
* Removed deprecated internal parameter "is_first_timestep" as this is now indicated by "time" that starts always at zero.
* Add input of coordinates (optional) and reading and conversion of coordinates given in weather data files (default)
* Add long wave irradiation as available profile for other components from weather file
* Add and improve tests to cover profile conversion algorithms
* Add default simulation parameters for tests
* Add Julia packages Dates, TimeZones, Proj (for coordinate transformation)
* For handling of timezones beyond 2038, files for a required recompilation of the package TimeZones and a description in the README has been included.

### Version 0.9.4
* Improve geothermal probe:
  * fix interpolation of g-functions
  * fix error if no regeneration is required
  * add import of custom g-function via txt file
  * add temperature limit for loading and unloading

### Version 0.9.3
* Apply autoformat to all remaining non-formatted files
  
### Version 0.9.2
* Add configuration for YAS code style using JuliaFormatter
* Add configuration for pre-commit hook to run the formatter automatically before a commit
* Extend README explaining things about the chosen code style and how to use it

### Version 0.9.1
* Add temperature layers in the input and output interfaces of components, if they need it. Currently only used by the heat pump, but solarthermal collector will follow.
* Refactor heat pump to handle temperature layer in the input and output interfaces and add a bypass if the input temperature is higher than the output temperature.
* Add method to deal with unknown energies at known temperatures for components during the potential step to avoid balance errors due to changed temperatures in process.
* Add basic functionalities for component-controlled order on busses. The respective control_modules are not included yet.
* Add two new scenarios "transformer_chain" and "hp_temperature_layer". Set new scenario reference due to bypass and correct calculation of COP for multiple heat layers in the output of heat pumps.
* Add output channels for temperatures for heat pump ("MixingTemperature_Input", "MixingTemperature_Output"), buffer tank ("CurrentMaxOutTemp") and geothermal probe ("current_input_temperature").

### Version 0.9.0
* Implement functionality of control modules, that can be added to components and that control the operation of the components via defined callback functions. This replaces the previous implementation of "strategies", as this was too limiting. The currently implemented control module types are:
  * economical_discharge: Handles the discharging of a battery to only be allowed if sufficient charge is available and a linked PV plant has available power below a given threshold. Mostly used for examplatory purposes.
  * profile_limited: Sets the maximum PLR of a component to values from a profile. Used to set the operation of a component to a fixed schedule while allowing circumstances to override the schedule in favour of lower values (e.g. the produced energy could not be used up completely).
  * storage_driven: Controls a component to only operate when the charge of a linked storage component falls below a certain threshold and keep operation until a certain higher threshold is reached. This is often used to avoid components switching on and off rapidly to keep a storage topped up, as realised systems often operate with this kind of hysteresis behaviour.
* Restructure how the operational strategy is defined in the input file. In particular:
  * Remove entry "strategy"
  * Remove entry "control_refs"
  * Add entry "control_modules" that holds the definitions of control modules active for this component
  * Add entry "control_parameters" as container for miscellaneous parameters of the control behaviour as well as parameters to configure the storage un-/loading flags and special flags to modify the potential step of transformers to not consider given interfaces in during calculation.
* Add scenario "chpp_two_hyst" to highlight the operation of a transformer with two storage_driven control modules

### Version 0.8.11
* Add optional temperature to the input or output interface of the grid component (constant temperature, from profile or from weather file)

### Version 0.8.10
* Major refactoring of the determination of the correct order of operation for transformer potential and process steps. Now, the order of operation for complex energy systems with branched transformer chains across busses can be determined automatically and these energy systems can be simulated. See the documentation for limitations and further details.
* Improve bus functionalities and efficiency calculations to allow the handling of branched transformer chains
* Add multiple tests to ensure the correct determination of the order of operation
* Set new reference results for all scenarios
* Add "is_first_timestep" to sim_params to be available for all components
  
### Version 0.8.9
* Add implementation for generic heat sources such as river water, lake water, waste water, atmosphere, industrial processes or one-way connections to a heat network. The main difference to a generic bounded supply is an option to include a temperature reduction caused by heat exchangers.
* Add scenario reversive_heat_pump to highlight open issues with the operation of a single heat pump for both heating and cooling with a seasonal heat storage

### Version 0.8.8
* Refactor part load ratio dependent efficiency (PLRDE) functionality to have its own submodule (of sorts)
* Refactor CHPP to use PLRDE functionality
* Refactor Electrolyser to use PLRDE functionality, a secondary low temperature heat output and a sub-unit model where efficiencies are specific to subunits that can be utilised to different degrees

### Version 0.8.7
* Add example and scenario that highlights how both heating and cooling can be handled at the same time by modelling the cooling demand as a fixed supply heat source

### Version 0.8.6
* Refactor fuel boiler to use a customisable part-load ratio dependent efficiency function. This functionality will likely also be used by other components in future releases.

### Version 0.8.5
* Fix a problem with general bounded supply and sink implementations not considering temperatures correctly. This was mostly an issue with direct 1-to-1 connections between components as busses do consider this already.

### Version 0.8.4
* Add geothermal probe as new component. It acts like a storage and there are many precalculated input parameters for a variety of probe field configurations. Both the simplified and the extended version were successfully validated.
* Add new szenario with geothermal probe and heat pump.
* Add geothermal collector files. This component is not finished yet and needs some rework.
* Add standalone julia code to create figures from profile data
* Add julia packages Roots and Plots
* Add function plot_optional_figures(), available to include in every component, that is called after initialize!() to create additional plots if the component offers them. Added optional flags in input file to control the auxiliary plots: auxiliary_plots, auxiliary_plots_path, auxiliary_plots_formats
* Bugfix in Resie.jl to call set_time_step ahead of the initialize!() of each component

### Version 0.8.3
* Tweak examples to match the description in the documentation
* Update profiles used in examples and move the files into subfolders
* Update installation and quick-use instructions

### Version 0.8.2
* Add testing and development feature "scenarios": Project files with certain expected outputs, which are used to test if the calculations have changed and thus produce different outputs than in the last verified version. This differs from unit tests in that the tests are not fully automated and require a certain expert knowledge to verify. The advantage over unit tests is that these outputs are less brittle and test cases can be added more easily.
* Add CLI for generating the output of scenarios, set reference outputs, compare the generated order of operations against the reference and generate an overview page over the scenario outputs
* Move most examples over to scenarios, as they were already used in such a manner. The remaining examples are intended to be developed as actual examples for new users of ReSiE.

### Version 0.8.1
* Rename output parameters `dump_info` and `dump_info_file` to `auxiliary_info` and `auxiliary_info_file`
* Rename output parameter `output_file` to `csv_output_file`
* Add output parameters `sankey_plot_file` and `output_plot_file` to allow control of where the plots will be saved
* Move input parameter `weather_file_path` from the `io_settings` section of the project config to the `simulation_parameters` section

### Version 0.8.0
* Standardise storage un-/loading control parameters for all components and make them customisable to the input/output media
* Remove operational strategy "extended_storage_loading_control"
* Update line plot & sankey outputs to better show missing demands
* Rework internal energy distribution calculations on busses:
  * If two or more busses are connected in a chain (necessarily of the same medium), a so-called proxy bus is created, which handles the calculations for any energy transfer from components on any of the principal/original busses
  * Remove the distinction of maximum potential energy utilisation (`max_energy`) and storage un-/loading potential, as the calculation on a bus considers storages according to the energy flow matrix as well as storage loading flags and thus does not require a distinction anymore. Direct 1-to-1 connections do not require this either, hence the removal.
  * Add automatically generated output channels for busses in a chain, where each bus tracks how much energy is transferred to other busses in the input->output direction
  * Some slight changes the generated order of operations, as this now makes use of the input and output order on proxy busses. This should not have an impact on results, but might change the order of operations compared to versions before v0.8.0.

### Version 0.7.1
* bugfix in sankey diagram if only one medium is present
* added possibility to not plot the sankey by adding "sankey_plot" to "io_settings"
* added possibility to define custom colors in sankey for each medium
* renamed input variable "output_keys" --> "csv_output_keys" in input file

### Version 0.7.0
#### Input and output
* Rename parameters and output variables across several components:
  * Load --> Demand                     in output channel of FixedSink
  * static_load --> constant_demand     for parameters of sinks
  * static_* --> constant_*             for parameters where * in (power, temperature, demand, supply)
  * fixed_cop --> constant_cop          for HeatPump
  * draw sum --> output_sum             in output channel of GridConnection
  * load sum --> input_sum              in output channel of GridConnection
  * power --> power_*                   for parameters of all transformers, where * in (el, th)
  * medium --> consider_medium          for control strategy parameters of all transformers
* Add output channel "Losses" to all components and to Sankey output. "Losses" are total losses, while "Losses_XX" are medium-wise break downs
* Constant values for fixed sources and sinks are now given as power instead of work/energy to be consistent with bounded sources and sinks
* Add global logging functionalities with the following categories: Debug, Info, BalanceWarn, Warn, Error and redirected all println() to logger (console and/or logging files, separately for general logs and Balancewarn)
* Update configuration options for busses:
  * Rename "connection_matrix" to "connections"
  * Rename "storage_loading" to "energy_flow"
  * Make "connections" a required part of the config for a bus, including items "input_order" and "output_order", however "energy_flow" remains optional
  * Remove "output_refs" item as "output_order" contains the same information and is now required

#### Functionality
* Sankey diagrams now display the difference of requested and delivered energy in fixed sinks and sources
* Remove condition "would overfill thermal buffer" in storage_driven strategy as this is now handled implicitly
* Add profile aggregation and segmentation with testcases
* Add import of weather files in EPW format and .dat format (DWD)
* Add functionality to map profiles from weather file to component profiles, like ambient temperature from the weather file to a geothermal collector

#### Fixes
* Fix generic storage implementation not being available due to the module not being included
* Fix the profile scaling factor of some components being required despite profiles being optional
* Add missing output channels to Electrolyser

#### Refactorings
* Change the input and output interfaces of busses such that the order matches the input and output priorities
* Rename helper function highest_temperature to highest and add types to inputs
* Provide docstrings for some structs and functions that were missing them
* Rename internal variables to match changes in the input and output variables mentioned above
* Remove last potential() step of transformer chains as this is not needed
* Add required Julia packages: Colors, Interpolations, Dates, Logging
* Rename argument "parameters" for simulation parameters to "sim_params" and add them to all components and profiles
* Rework communication of balances, energy/storage potentials and temperatures via busses. This is an extensive rework that touches almost all components and how the `process` and `potential` simulation steps work. Please note that the rework is not finished with v0.7.0 and will continue to support more energy systems and component configurations that might be of interest to users. However no compatibility is knowingly broken with examples that worked in previous versions.

### Version 0.6.5
* "output_keys" and "output_plot" in the input file can now be "all", "nothing" or a list of entries for custom outputs of the CSV file and lineplot (backwards compatibility is given)
* output_values() of all components was changed to not only return the available channels, but also the corresponding media
* restructured "run_simulation()" for better readability

### Version 0.6.4
* Generalise implementation of gas boiler to that of a fuel boiler
  * Although this implicates the use of a chemical fuel to generate heat, the current implementation works with any kind of input including electricity

### Version 0.6.3
* Remove abstract subtype ControlledComponent and use abstract top-level type Component in its stead
* Add a generic implementation for storage components
* Standardise the generic implementations of fixed/bounded sources/sinks by:
  * adding options for static power/energy and temperature values instead of mandatory profiles
  * making Demand an alias to generic implementation FixedSink
* Add "Load%" output for storage components making outputting the state of charge more convenient

### Version 0.6.2
* Added part-load-ratio efficiency calculation for gas boiler component

### Version 0.6.1
* corrected wrong units given for output_plot in example files

### Version 0.6.0
* Refactor terms and names used to refer to various concepts in the simulation model:
  * energy system => component
  * energy network / system topology => energy system
  * production => processing, and variations thereof, including the simulation step produce => process
  * Module EnergySystems remains named the same as the functionality still concerns the modelling of energy systems. In this regard the old name was too limited on the components of an energy system
* Change keys "energy_systems" and "production_refs" in project file to "components" and "output_refs" 

### Version 0.5.7
* Refactor function watt_to_wh as a global function in module EnergySystems

### Version 0.5.6
* Calculation of COP of heat pump changed from dummy implementation to Carnot COP with 40% efficiency and adjusted tests accordingly.
* OoO for control steps changed: The OoO of the controls now corresponds to the base order without any rearrangement! This was necessary to ensure that the transformers are controlled before the storages. Tests were adapted accordingly.
* Added dummy implementation and example file for geothermal probes and geothermal heat collectors.
  
### Version 0.5.5
* minor changes in the output line plot and exemplary input files

### Version 0.5.4
* Fix link to documentation

### Version 0.5.3
* Choose license: MIT
* Update link to documentation

### Version 0.5.2
* updated example input files and their profile data (now given in specific values related to the net floor area or net PV area)

### Version 0.5.1
* Added additional rule to the calculation of OoO that handles multiple buses with storages and transformers that feed energy into leaf busses. The added function adjusts the position of the load() step of the storages in the OoO to ensure that the energy from the leaf transformer is not fed into the wrong storage.

### Version 0.5.0
* Split library and CLI part of Resie into two files. This allows including Resie as a library without immediately executing anything, which is especially useful for tests. At the moment the CLI does nothing but pipe arguments to the library part, but can be extended in the future, for example for additional commands other than running a simulation.

### Version 0.4.1
* balance_on() now always returns the temperature if it is given
* added control() on all energy systems with temperatures to write the required temperatures to the interfaces
* control() of sinks and sources reworked to do the same thing
* adapted tests and added new tests to check the temperatures returned by balance_on()
* added optional input and output temperatures of transformers as user input
* changed example_WP_Kascade to dynamic COP calculation depending on dynamic demand temperatures

### Version 0.4.0
* Rename dispatchable sinks and sources to bounded sinks and sources

### Version 0.3.9
* added optional input of custom OoO to the input file using the "order_of_operation" section and changed the format of the output of "dump_info" to allow copy and paste of OoO to the input file
* added tests for loading user-defined OoOs
* activated tests for transformers-in-a-row
* reworked balance_on() of the bus to allow transformers to differ between storage_potential and energy_potential in their input_interfaces
* added tests to check the new balance_on() of the bus and the functionality of the "unload_storages" flag in the demand-driven control strategy

### Version 0.3.8
* Fix issue with the signs of field max_energy being set for interfaces by energy systems. It is now always positive and method balance_on returns the energy potential with the correct sign depending on whether the caller is input or output in respect to the interface.
* Rework the implementations of energy systems GasBoiler, HeatPump and CHPP to use the new simulation step potential so that their potential and production calculations work correctly for any chain of transformers
* Minor readability improvements
* Remove potential calculations for transformer chains of length 1, as these calculations are superfluous by definition
* Remove reordering of order of operations for control dependencies, as these reorderings have become superfluous with the other reorderings covering the same cases

### Version 0.3.7
* adapted OoO for storages according the following rules:
  1. produce() and load() from leaves to trunk
  2. produce() and load() of leaves are in order of output interfaces of trunk busses
  3. produce() and load() of loading-limited storages are calculated after loading-unlimited storages with respect to the loading_matrix in busses
* adapted and added test for new calculation order of storages

### Version 0.3.6
* Refactor algorithm for determining order of operations for a more modular approach with reusable helper functions and add tests for new modular functions.
* Add helper functions for improving output of tests checking the order of operations
* Add simulation step for calculating energy potentials. The default method does nothing and transformer implementations ought to calculate their potentials in the step and write the information to the interfaces.
* Add handling of chains of transformers to order of operations algorithm. The algorithm iterates over each chain in one pass sink-to-source, adding potential steps along the way, then another pass source-to-sink adding the produce steps.
* Add deactivated tests highlighting problems with transformer chains - the tests fail until transformer implementations for potentials are added
* Add handling of storage loading to order of operations algorithm. The algorithm considers the output priorities on chains of busses for the loading of storages connected to all busses of a chain.

### Version 0.3.5
* added extended_storage_control strategy for all storages to allow users to decide whether a storage can load ANY other interconnected storage of the system framework or not (default = storages are not allowed to load other storages). This only works if the OoO of produce() and load() is correct which will be implemented in upcoming versions.
* changed definition in balance_on() of busses: Storages are never allowed to load themselves!
* adjusted testcases to meet new definition above
* added testcases to test extended_storage_control

### Version 0.3.4
* added feature to control transformers from user-given control profile with values within [0,1]. This adds to the already existing limitations in the control strategy of demand_driven, supply_driven and storage_driven strategy.
* bugfix in index assignment of connectivity matrix to output_interfaces in balance_on() of bus
* changed calculation of COP of heatpump: If fixed_cop is given in the input file, it will be used and not the temperature-dependent COP. Corrected tests to meet this definition.

### Version 0.3.3
* bugfix in calculation of IN and OUT energy in output_value() for chases with balance /= 0. 

### Version 0.3.2
* adapted control strategies for all transformers: All in- and outputs need to be satisfied by default
* added optional user-defined input in control strategy of each transformer to ignore certain in- or outputs within control strategy
* added optional user-defined input in control strategy of each transformer to allow or deny system-wide storage loading or unloading
* changed max_power to max_energy for all energy systems in outputs and unit structs
* added max_energy to interfaces and control() of grids, sources and sinks in order to provide information on how many energy is available or can be taken, calculated in balance_on(), to meet new control strategies of transformers
* adapted balance_on() to also return energy_potential (if sum_abs_change /= 0) that represents the potential maximum energy in- or output at unit (former potential is now named storage_potential, balance_on() returns now a named tuple instead of tuples)
* added and corrected tests to meet new control strategies and test new functionalities 
* adapted examples to meet new functionalities

### Version 0.3.1
* Added tests for demand_driven strategy with and without bus between transformer and demand
* Adapted default control strategy of gasboiler and heatpump to enable storage-filling

### Version 0.3.0
* Implement connectivity matrix on bus systems for controlling which producer can load which storage on the same bus
* Remove operational strategy "use_surplus_in_cycle" as it is no longer needed with this new feature
* Move definitions of input and output priorities into connectivity matrix

### Version 0.2.11
* Implemented user-definable media for all energy systems
* Adaption of tests to the new user-definable media names

* Bugfix in determination of order of Distribute() of busses
* Added user-definable medium names in input file (only for electrolyser for now)
* Bugfix in SeasonalThermalStorage (missing declaration)
* Revice of exemplary system frameworks
* Adapted testcases to meet the changes

### Version 0.2.7:
* Restructure test cases so that each case can be debugged
* Update existing and add new tests to highlight several problems that occur when bus systems are connected

### Version 0.2.6:
* Refactor operational strategies for GasBoiler, CHPP, Electrolyser
* Implement way to track the energy flow between connected busses
* Improve sankey output (hide null-flows and hide O2)
* Refactor order of operations to include distribution between connected busses
* Bugfix in distribution calculation of bus systems
* Change examples to illustrate current problems
* Change how temperatures are read from profile files
* Make feature of load-dependant temperatures of heat storages optional

### Version 0.2.5:
* Refactor and fix how the storage loading potential and temperatures are transferred across busses, in particular when multiple busses are connected in series

### Version 0.2.4:
* added example of system topology Esslingen in different variants
* added profiles for PV, heat demand
* removed deprecated code in pv_plant.jl

### Version 0.2.3:
* Fix energy balance and distribution calculations of busses not working correctly for system topologies in which two bus systems are connected directly
* Fix distribution overwriting temperatures on system interfaces

### Version 0.2.2:
* fixed bug with coloring of the medium in Sankey occurring in file_output.jl when only one medium is present in energy topology
* added example input file with one medium and two busses in paralell (currently not working!)

### Version 0.2.1:
* added automated generation of sankey diagram in output. Requires additional package "ColorSchemes" from Plotly.

### Version 0.2.0:
* changed PV-System input from power (sin-function) to given power/energy profile scaled by scale factor

### Version 0.1.0:
* Initial release that encompasses the entire development before versioning
* Add a changelog
* Start of versioning oriented by semantic versioning
