    find_chains(components, sys_function; direct_connection_only=true)

Find all chains of the given system function in the given collection of components.

A chain is a subgraph of the graph spanned by all connections of the given components,
which is a directed graph. The subgraph is defined by all connected components of the given
system function.
The optional flag direct_connection_only specifies if the chain should also be found
across busses and other component types. If the flag is set to false, the unique chains
that interconnect the components of sys_function are found. Components are only defined as
interconnected if they can be seen EITHER in the outputs or the inputs, but not via mixed 
input/output paths! 

Chains found with direct_connection_only=false are filtered to find unique chains. They are
merged to represent the longest possible chain and to avoid doublings or multiple subset of
a bigger chain. Completely independent chains are returned as array of chains.

# Arguments
-`components`: All components of the current energy system
-`sys_function`: The system function for that the chains should be determined in components
-`direct_connection_only::Bool}`: Flag if direct (true) or indirect chains across other
                                  components should be determined (false)

This function determines the order of the potential or process calculation steps for transformers in a given EnergySystem.
Note that the algorithm may not determine the correct order of operation or find the most computationally efficient solution!

The following logic is used:
- At first, "middle transformers" (MT) are searched within the current_components. An MT is defined as a transformer with 
  at least one other transformer in each of at least two inputs and/or at least one transformer in each of at least 
  two outputs. If there is more than one MT in the current_components, the "first" MT is chosen to start with, 
  where "first" means that there are no other MTs in its input branches. 
- Of the chosen MT, the longer branch is taken and the add_transformer_steps is called recursively with the 
  transformer of the current branch handed over as new current_components. If branches have interdependencies, the 
  order of the branches is adjusted accordingly to calculate the dependencies first. With the components of each branch, 
  the function add_transformer_steps is called recursively. The branches are starting to potential from "outside", 
  meaning each branch starts at the point that is away from the MT. Then the MT does its potential, after all branches
  have finished. During process, the MT does its process first, then the branches do their process starting from the
  "inside" with the components near the MT.
- If there is no MT in the current_components, then "middle busses" (MB) are searched within the current_components.
  MBs are defined as busses with more than one input and/or more than one output interface with each containing at least
  one other transformer. If there are several MBs in the current_components, the first MB is chosen that has no other
  MBs in its inputs (reverse === nothing || reverse == false) or in its outputs (reverse == true).
- If the current reverse is false or nothing, first the input branches and then the output branches are given recursively 
  to add_transformer_steps(). If reverse is true, the output branches come first. If branches have interdependencies, the 
  order of the branches is adjusted accordingly to calculate the dependencies first, but only at potential step!
- If the current_components are part of a parallel_branch (PB), then they are merged together into one branch. PBs are 
  defined as branches that offer more than one way between two busses, with each way containing at least one 
  other transformer (while considering the direction of energy flow).
  Note that MBs within the parallel branches cannot be considered correctly at the moment!
- If no MB or MT can be found in the current_components, the process or potential of them is determined by their order in 
  the energy system. The direction is set by reverse, which defaults to true (process step) or false (potential step). 
  If one of the components is part of a parallel branch, this is detected and the parallels are handled separately: 
  Depending on the output order (input order is not considered here, but logically they should be the same. Reordering
  for input is done later in calculate_order_of_operations, but should not do anything) of the MB, each of the 
  parallel branches performs its potentials in both ways to ensure that possible limitations reach both ends before 
  continuing with the next branch of the parallel branches.
- Generally: Connections between components are interrupted if:
    - there is a storage (no bypass directly through a storage!)
    - the connection matrix of a bus denies the connection
    - the input component into a bus is connected to an output grid out of the bus (considering the energy matrix)
    - an output component out of a bus is connected to an input grid in the bus (considering the energy matrix)
- To avoid double-counting components, all considered components are tracked in checked_components, which is updated 
  before each recursive function call. Note that in some cases, components can be considered multiple times if they are 
  part of multiple branches at one MB or MT! Therefore, after the order has been determined, only the first appearance of 
  the process is considered and all other process steps of the same component are deleted from the order of operation. 
  For potential steps, this is not done as in some cases, components have to have multiple potential steps.
- If an MB is connected to another MB, the first MB holds the second MB in one of its output branches. When determining
  the correct calculation order of the components to the rear MB, the connection branch has to perform its potentials
  after all of the other branches of the rear MB. To detect this, branches can get a connecting_component, defining the
  component that is connected to another MB (or MT) and implicitly also the direction.

- `simulation_order::Array[]`: The simulation order that should be extended by transformers' potentials and processes.
- `initial_nr::Int`: The current number of steps in the order of operation.
- `current_components::Array{Grouping}`: The currently considered components. Should be transformers and busses at
                                         initial call.

- `step_category::String`: Can be either "potential" or "process", depending on the simulation step to find for 
                           current_components.
  Optional:
- `reverse::Bool`: Indicates if the current_components should be considered in reverse or not. Can also be nothing at 
                   the initial call and defaults to nothing.
- `connecting_component::Component`: Can be either nothing or a connecting component, indicates that the 
                                     current_components are part of a connecting branch. Defaults to nothing.
- `checked_components::Array{Grouping}`: A vector holding all checked components. Defaults to an empty vector. 

# Returns

load and if a connection from this branch to at least one branch of the opposite direction is allowed.

duplication. Duplicated branches are appended to the end of the branch array and the corresponding entries in

This function detects the order of the branches under consideration of interdependencies between the branches.
If a component in one branch has a component of another branch in its inputs (while not 
considering the path through the middle transformer), the other branch has to be calculated first (potential) or 
last (process).
As base order, the number of transformers within each branch is used, starting with the longest.
Also, reverse the order of the input branches so that they start with the first (nearest to source) element.

    detect_middle_bus(current_components, reverse, checked_components)

This function searches for middle_busses in the current_components.
Middle_busses are busses with more than one input and/or more than one output interfaces, each with at least one transformer.
Returns the first/last middle bus that has no other middle bus in its inputs/outputs, depending on whether reverse is 
true (last) or false/nothing (first). 
Branches are returned in ascending input/output order of the bus, starting with the highest priority.
Considers only current components that are not in checked_components, but also possibly connected upstream transformers
in an output and the other way around.
The components in each branch are sorted by their distance to the middle_bus, meaning for input branches, the order

"""
    detect_first_middle_transformer(current_components, checked_components)

This function searches for a middle_transformer in the current_components.
Middle_transformers are transformers with either more than one input interface or more than one output interface, each 
with at least one transformer. Transformers with two input AND two output interfaces with one or more transformers each 
are not considered (currently, no component is implemented for which this could be the case).
Returns the first middle transformer that has no other middle transformer in its inputs.
Branches are returned in ascending input/output order of the transformer, starting with the highest priority.
Considers only current_components that are not in checked_components, but also possibly connected upstream transformers
in an output and the other way around.
The components in each branch are sorted by their distance to the middle_bus, meaning for input branches, the order
is reversed and for output branches, the order of energy flow is kept.

# Arguments
- `current_components::Array{Grouping}`: The currently considered components.
- `checked_components::Array{Grouping}`: A vector holding all checked components. 

# Returns
- `first_middle_transformer::Component`: The first middle transformer as a component.
- `inface_branches_with_transformers::Array{Array{Components}}`: An array of arrays holding the transformers and busses 
                                                                 of each input branch of the first_middle_transformer.

"""
    find_parallels(components)

This function searches for parallel branches in the components of the energy system.
Parallel branches are defined as at least two connections between two busses, each containing at least one transformer.
Returns a dictionary with all parallel branches of the current energy system.
The components in each branch are sorted by the direction of the energy flow, starting with the start_point component.
The branches are sorted by the output order of the start_point component.
For busses with proxy busses, only the proxy busses are taken into account.

# Arguments
- `components::Array{Grouping}`: All components of the current energy system

# Returns
- `final_paths::Dict{Array{Array}}`: A dictionary containing parallel branches. The key is (start_point_uac, end_point_uac).
                                     Each key contains a vector of vectors where each one holds one path from start_point
                                     to the end_point. A path consists of the components, including the start_point and 
                                     end_point components.

    distance_to_sink(node, sys_function, checked_interfaces)

Calculate the distance of the given node to the sinks of the chain.

A sink is defined as a node with no successors of the same system function. For the sinks
this distance is 0. For all other nodes it is the maximum over the distances of its
successors plus one. Only allowed connections are considered specified by the energy matrix 
of busses.
The parameter "checked_interfaces" is used to avoid loops when recursively calling the 
function. When calling distance_to_sink() from outside, the parameter checked_interfaces 
should be set as empty array ([]).

# Arguments
-`node`: A specific component (unit) for which the distance to the sink should be determined
-`sys_function`: The system function of the components in the chain
-`checked_interfaces::Array{SystemInterface}`: An array holding the already checked system 
                                               interfaces. Should be [] when calling externally.

"""
    connection_allowed(component::Component, input_uac::String, output_uac::String)

Checks a given connection defined by `input_uac` and `output_uac` is allowed. The `component`
is the component between the two other components. If `component` is not a bus, this function
will return true. If component is a bus, then the connection matrix of the bus is checked 
to determine if the connection from input_uac to output_uac is allowed. 

# Arguments
-`component::Component`: A component between input_uac and output_uac
-`input_uac::String`: The uac of the input component
-`output_uac::String`: The uac of the output component

# Returns
Returns either "true" if `component` is a non-bus or if the connection is allowed, or "false" 
if `component` is a bus and the energy flow is denied by the energy flow matrix.
