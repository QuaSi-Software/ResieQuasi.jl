    parse_efficiency_function(eff_def, uac, param_name)

Parse the given definition of an efficiency function and return it as a callable function.

The function should return an efficiency factor e (on [0,1]) given an input of the part load
ratio (PLR) value (on [0,1]).

The definition looks like this: `function_prototype:list_of_numbers` with
`function_prototype` being a string (see below) and `list_of_numbers` being a comma-
seperated list of numbers with a period as decimal seperator and no thousands-seperator. The
meaning of the numbers depends on the function prototype.

Three different function prototypes are implemented:
    * const: Takes one number and uses it as a constant efficiency factor.
    * poly: Takes a list of numbers and uses them as the coefficients of a polynomial with
        order n-1 where n is the length of coefficients. The list starts with coefficients
        of the highest order. E.g. `poly:0.5,2.0,0.1` means e(x)=0.5x²+2x+0.1
    * pwlin: A piece-wise linear interpolation. Takes a list of numbers and uses them as
        support values for an even distribution of linear sections on the interval [0,1].
        The PLR-values (on the x axis) are implicit with a step size equal to the inverse of
        the length of support values minus 1. The first and last support values are used as
        the values for a PLR of 0.0 and 1.0 respectively. E.g. `pwlin:0.6,0.8,0.9` means
        two sections of step size 0.5 with a value of e(0.0)==0.6, e(0.5)==0.8, e(1.0)=0.9
        and linear interpolation inbetween.
    * offset_lin: Takes one number and uses as the slope of a linear function with an offset
        of its complement (in regards to 1.0). E.g. `offset_lin:0.5` means
        e(x)=1.0-0.5*(1.0-x)
    * logarithmic: Takes two numbers and uses them as the coefficients of a
        quasi-logarithmic function. E.g. `logarithmic:0.5,0.3` means
        e(x)=0.5x/(0.3x+(1-0.3))
    * inv_poly: Takes a list of numbers and uses them as the coefficients of a polynomial
        with order n-1 where n is the length of coefficients. The list starts with
        coefficients of the highest order. The inverse of the polynomial multiplied with the
        PLR is used as the efficiency function. E.g. `inv_poly:0.5,2.0,0.1`
        means e(x)=x/(0.5x²+2x+0.1)
    * power_func: A power function of the form e(x) = a * x^b with two coefficients a and b.
        E.g. `power_func:100,0.95`
    * linear: A linear function of the form e(x) = a * x + b with two coefficient a and b.
        E.g. `lin:25.0,3.0` means e(x) = 25.0 * x + 3.0. 
        b can also be empty, E.g. `lin:25.0` is equivalent to e(x) = 25.0 * x + 0.0. 
    * exp: Takes three numbers and uses them as the coefficients of an exponential function.
        E.g. `exp:0.1,0.2,0.3` means e(x)=0.1+0.2*exp(0.3x)
    * unified_plf: Takes four numbers and uses them as the coefficients of a composite
        function of a logarithmic and linear function as described in the documentation on
        the unified formulation for PLR-dependent efficiencies of heat pumps. The first two
        numbers are the optimal PLR and the PLF at that PLR. The third number is a scaling
        factor for the logarithmic part and the fourth number is the PLF at PLR=1.0.

- `uac::String`: The UAC of the component of the parameter, for error messages
- `param_name::String`: The parameter name of the parameter, for error messages

    create_plr_lookup_tables(unit)

Approximates the inverse of the PLRDE from energy values as lookup table.

This is required to calculate the part load ratio of a component from an energy value of
consumed or produced energy. Because the inverse is not always analytically known, it is
numerically approximated at fixed intervals of the PLR. The lookup table can then be
searched for the bounds around a known energy value and linear interpolation between these
bounds results in the approximation of the inverse function.

A warning is logged if the calculated inverse, as a piece-wise linear function, is not
monotonically increasing. This can happen if the efficiency function is not linear and has
strong gradients. Simulation can continue, but may result in inconsistent behaviour as
multiple solutions exist.

    plr_from_energy(unit, energy_value)

Calculate the part load ratio as inverse function from the given energy value.

The PLRDE is defined such that one input or output is linear in respect to the PLR, while
the other inputs and outputs need to be calculated as the inverse of their efficiency
function, where that efficiency is relative to the linear input/output.

As the efficiency function can be a variety of functions and is not necessarily (easily)
invertable, the inverse is calculated numerically at initialisation as a piece-wise linear
function from a customizable number of support values from an even distribution of a PLR
from 0.0 to 1.0. When calling plr_from_energy this approximated function is evaluated for
the given energy value and a linear interpolation between the two surrounding support values
is performed to calculate the corresponding PLR.

- `interface::Symbol`: The interface to which the energy value corresponds. This should be
    one of the names defined in field `interface_list` of the component.

    check_heat_out_layered(unit, interface, medium, output_temperature, sim_params)

Checks the available energy on the output high temperature heat interface of the electrolyser.
Includes the required check for return temperatures for the control module "limit_cooling_input_temperature".
Therefore, it returns not only the energies but also the corresponding target_uac.

# Arguments
- `unit::Electrolyser`: The component
- `interface_name::String`: The name of the interface, e.g. "heat_ht_out"
- `medium::Symbol`: The medium of the interface, e.g. `:m_heat_ht_out`
- `output_temperature::Floathing`: The output temperature of the electrolyser for 1-to-1 temperature checks
- `sim_params::Dict{String,Any}`: Simulation parameters
# Returns
- `Vector{Floathing}`: The requested energy on the interface as one layer per target. The
    value can be `-Inf`, which is a special floating point value signifying a negative
    infinite value.
- `Vector{Stringing}`: The UACs of the targets on the interface corresponding to the energies.
